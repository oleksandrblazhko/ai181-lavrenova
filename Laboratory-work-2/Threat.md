|----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|------:|
| 1 | Browser-Web-Server-Request| Spoofing |Spoofing the Browser External Entity |Browser may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to unauthorized access to Web Server. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the external entity.|
| 2 |    Browser-Web-Server-Request (HTTP)   |   Tampering |Cross Site Scripting|The web server 'Web Server' could be a subject to a cross-site scripting attack because it does not sanitize untrusted input.|
| 3 | Browser-Web-Server-Request (HTTP) |    Elevation of privilege |Elevation Using Impersonation|Web Server may be able to impersonate the context of Browser in order to gain additional privilege.|
| 4 | Web-Server-Web-App-Request (Socket)  |    Tampering |Web Server Process Memory Tampered|If Web Server is given access to memory, such as shared memory or pointers, or is given the ability to control what Web Application executes (for example, passing back a function pointer.), then Web Server can tamper with Web Application. Consider if the function could work with less access to memory, such as passing data rather than pointers. Copy in data provided, and then validate it.|
| 5 | Web-Server-Web-App-Request (Socket)  |    Tampering |Cross Site Scripting|The web server 'Web Application' could be a subject to a cross-site scripting attack because it does not sanitize untrusted input.|
| 6 | Web-Server-Web-App-Request (Socket)  | Elevation of privilege|Elevation Using Impersonation|Web Application may be able to impersonate the context of Web Server in order to gain additional privilege.|
| 7 | Web-App-DB-Request |    Spoofing |Spoofing of Destination Data Store SQL Database|SQL Database may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being written to the attacker's target instead of SQL Database. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination data store.|
| 8 | Web-App-DB-Request |   Tampering |Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability for SQL Database|SQL injection is an attack in which malicious code is inserted into strings that are later passed to an instance of SQL Server for parsing and execution. Any procedure that constructs SQL statements should be reviewed for injection vulnerabilities because SQL Server will execute all syntactically valid queries that it receives. Even parameterized data can be manipulated by a skilled and determined attacker.|
| 9 | Web-App-DB-Request |    Denial of Service |Potential Excessive Resource Consumption for Web Application or SQL Database|Does Web Application or SQL Database take explicit steps to control resource consumption? Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout.|
| 10 | Web-App-DB-Response |    Spoofing |Spoofing of Source Data Store SQL Database|SQL Database may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to incorrect data delivered to Web Application. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the source data store.|
| 11| Web-App-DB-Response |    Tampering |Cross Site Scripting|The web server 'Web Application' could be a subject to a cross-site scripting attack because it does not sanitize untrusted input.|
| 12 | Web-App-DB-Response |    Tampering |Persistent Cross Site Scripting|The web server 'Web Application' could be a subject to a persistent cross-site scripting attack because it does not sanitize data store 'SQL Database' inputs and output.|
| 13 | Web-App-DB-Response |    Information Disclosure |Weak Access Control for a Resource|Improper data protection of SQL Database can allow an attacker to read information not intended for disclosure. Review authorization settings.|
| 14 | Web-Server-Web-App-Response (Socket) |    Tampering |Cross Site Scripting|The web server 'Web Server' could be a subject to a cross-site scripting attack because it does not sanitize untrusted input.|
| 15 | Web-Server-Web-App-Response (Socket) |    Elevation of privilege |Elevation Using Impersonation|Web Server may be able to impersonate the context of Web Application in order to gain additional privilege.|
| 16 | Browser-Web-Server-Request (HTTP) |    Spoofing |Spoofing the Web Server Process|Web Server may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to information disclosure by Browser. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination process.|
| 17 | Browser-Web-Server-Request (HTTP) |   Tampering |Potential Lack of Input Validation for Web Server|Data flowing across Browser-Web-Server-Request (HTTP) may be tampered with by an attacker. This may lead to a denial of service attack against Web Server or an elevation of privilege attack against Web Server or an information disclosure by Web Server. Failure to verify that input is as expected is a root cause of a very large number of exploitable issues. Consider all paths and the way they handle data. Verify that all input is verified for correctness using an approved list input validation approach.|
| 18 | Browser-Web-Server-Request (HTTP) |    Repudiation |Potential Data Repudiation by Web Server|Web Server claims that it did not receive data from a source outside the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data.|
| 19 | Browser-Web-Server-Request (HTTP) |    Information Disclosure |Data Flow Sniffing|Data flowing across Browser-Web-Server-Request (HTTP) may be sniffed by an attacker. Depending on what type of data an attacker can read, it may be used to attack other parts of the system or simply be a disclosure of information leading to compliance violations. Consider encrypting the data flow.|
|20|Browser-Web-Server-Request (HTTP)|Denial of Service|Potential Process Crash or Stop for Web Server|Web Server crashes, halts, stops or runs slowly; in all cases violating an availability metric.|
|21|Browser-Web-Server-Request (HTTP)|Denial of Service|Data Flow Browser-Web-Server-Request Is Potentially Interrupted|An external agent interrupts data flowing across a trust boundary in either direction.|
|22 |Browser-Web-Server-Request (HTTP)|Elevation of privilege|Web Server May be Subject to Elevation of Privilege Using Remote Code Execution|Browser may be able to remotely execute code for Web Server.|
|23|Browser-Web-Server-Request (HTTP)|Elevation of privilege|Elevation by Changing the Execution Flow in Web Server|An attacker may pass data into Web Server in order to change the flow of program execution within Web Server to the attacker's choosing.|
|24|Browser-Web-Server-Response (HTTP)|Spoofing|Spoofing of the Browser External Destination Entity|Browser may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being sent to the attacker's target instead of Browser. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the external entity.|
|25|Browser-Web-Server-Response (HTTP)|Repudiation|External Entity Browser Potentially Denies Receiving Data|Browser claims that it did not receive data from a process on the other side of the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data.|
|26|Browser-Web-Server-Response (HTTP)|Denial of Service|Data Flow Browser-Web-Server-Response Is Potentially Interrupted|An external agent interrupts data flowing across a trust boundary in either direction.|
|27|Web-Server-HTML-Request|Spoofing|Spoofing of Destination Data Store HTML5 Local Storage|HTML5 Local Storage may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being written to the attacker's target instead of HTML5 Local Storage. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination data store.|
|28|Web-Server-HTML-Request|Denial of Service|Potential Excessive Resource Consumption for Web Server or HTML5 Local Storage|Does Web Server or HTML5 Local Storage take explicit steps to control resource consumption? Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout.|
|29|Web-Server-HTML-Response|Spoofing|Spoofing of Source Data Store HTML5 Local Storage|HTML5 Local Storage may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to incorrect data delivered to Web Server. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the source data store.|
|30|Web-Server-HTML-Response|Tampering|Cross Site Scripting|The web server 'Web Server' could be a subject to a cross-site scripting attack because it does not sanitize untrusted input.|
