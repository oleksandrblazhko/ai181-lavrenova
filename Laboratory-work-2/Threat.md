|6|Web-App-DB-Request|	Information Disclosure|An adversary can read confidential data due to weak connection string configuration|An adversary can read confidential data due to weak connection string configuration
|7|Web-App-DB-Request|Elevation of Privileges|An adversary can gain unauthorized access to Azure SQL DB instances due to weak network security configuration.|An adversary can gain unauthorized access to Azure SQL DB instances due to weak network security configuration.
|8|Web-App-DB-Request|Elevation of Privileges|An adversary can gain unauthorized access to Azure SQL database due to weak account policy|Due to poorly configured account policies, adversary can launch brute force attacks on Azure SQL Database|
|9|Web-App-DB-Response|Tampering|An adversary can gain access to sensitive data stored in Web App's config files|An adversary can gain access to the config files. and if sensitive data is stored in it, it would be compromised.|
|10|Web-App-DB-Response|Tampering|An adversary can gain access to sensitive data by performing SQL injection through Web App|SQL injection is an attack in which malicious code is inserted into strings that are later passed to an instance of SQL Server for parsing and execution. The primary form of SQL injection consists of direct insertion of code into user-input variables that are concatenated with SQL commands and executed. A less direct attack injects malicious code into strings that are destined for storage in a table or as metadata. When the stored strings are subsequently concatenated into a dynamic SQL command, the malicious code is executed.|
|11|Web-App-DB-Response|	Spoofing|An adversary may spoof Azure SQL Database and gain access to Web Application|If proper authentication is not in place, an adversary can spoof a source process or external entity and gain unauthorized access to the Web Application|
|12|Web-App-DB-Response|	Spoofing|An adversary can create a fake website and launch phishing attacks|Phishing is attempted to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly, money), often for malicious reasons, by masquerading as a Web Server which is a trustworthy entity in electronic communication|
|13|Web-App-DB-Response|Spoofing|An adversary can steal sensitive data like user credentials|Attackers can exploit weaknesses in system to steal user credentials. Downstream and upstream components are often accessed by using credentials stored in configuration stores. Attackers may steal the upstream or downstream component credentials. Attackers may steal credentials if, Credentials are stored and sent in clear text, Weak input validation coupled with dynamic sql queries, Password retrieval mechanism are poor,|
|14|Web-App-DB-Response|	Spoofing|An adversary can spoof the target web application due to insecure TLS certificate configuration|Ensure that TLS certificate parameters are configured with correct values|
|15|Web-App-DB-Response|Repudiation|Attacker can deny the malicious act and remove the attack foot prints leading to repudiation issues|Proper logging of all security events and user actions builds traceability in a system and denies any possible repudiation issues. In the absence of proper auditing and logging controls, it would become impossible to implement any accountability in a system|
|16|Web-App-DB-Response|Information Disclosure|An adversary can gain access to sensitive information through error messages|An adversary can gain access to sensitive data such as the following, through verbose error messages - Server names  - Connection strings  - Usernames  - Passwords  - SQL procedures  - Details of dynamic SQL failures  - Stack trace and lines of code  - Variables stored in memory  - Drive and folder locations  - Application install points  - Host configuration settings  - Other internal application details|
